    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This website is a complement to the Design with Data report. It summarises the five components of intimacy, and presents a prototype of the audiovisual interactions intended for the physical exhibit.</p>

    <h2>Prototype</h2>
    <p>Below is a prototype of the exhibit, showcasing the imagined interaction between user inputs and the audiovisual output. The red and green knobs represent the two people using the exhibit; in the physical exhibit, these knobs would be placed on opposite sides of the wall, and people would be able to cycle through the questions independently of each other. The visual output shows what the projection in the physical exhibit would be displaying.
    Here's how to explore the prototype:
  <ul> 
    <li><span class="bolded">To start, click on the top-right SOUND button. You can use it to mute the prototype as well</span></li>
    <li>Click and drag your mouse up or down to change the value of a knob. A knob turned to the left means you care little about that category, while a knob turned to the right means you care a lot about that category </li>
    <li>Use the left and right buttons to navigate between questions</li>
    <li>The first three knobs affect the audio, the other two affect the visuals; the audio also affects the visuals by itself</li>
  </ul>
    </p>
     <p class="smalltext">The prototype uses the <a href="http://codeforartists.com/RotatingKnobMaker/">Rotating Knobs library</a> by Miles Decoster, and the <a href="https://therewasaguy.github.io/p5-music-viz/">Time Domain Oscilloscope</a> by Jason Sigal. If the sound doesn't seem to work, please try opening the website on another browser.</p>

    <div id="sketch-holder"></div>

    <h2>Matching mechanic</h2>
    <p>
      The prototype starts in a state where both people's answers are similar, and the knobs have identical positions; they are considered very compatible. This is reflected in the audiovisual output, through having a more colourful visualisation with a thicker oscilloscope line, and the various sound effects sounding good together. If the answers of the two people do not match at all, they are considered incompatible. The visualisation is darker, the line is thinner, and the audio pans on the left/right while the sounds conflict with each other, to show the distance between their answers. As the knobs are interacted with, the changes in audiovisual output can be seen and heard in real-time, and reflect the level of agreement of the two people's answers.</li>
